I suppose you have decided to have a go at sewing your own clothes, but sewing patterns look scary and difficult to understand. Let me help you with everything you need to know from how to choose a suitable sewing pattern through to reading and understanding the information on the sewing packet. Firstly, choose a sewing pattern and its size. If you are just starting out sewing it is probably best to choose designs that are relatively easy to sew. Next, the really exciting part - which fabric will you use and how much do you need? You can choose of cotton, silk, wool, polyester and much more. I suggest you prepare the sewMachine and all the sewing pieces in advance. Now you can start sewing the textile according to the marks instructions. Enjoy!
