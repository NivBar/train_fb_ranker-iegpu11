A single solar module can produce only a limited amount of power. Therefore a photovoltaic system includes an array of solar modules, a solar inverter, a battery and solar tracker and interconnection wiring. The solar panels works better in the summer because there is more sun hours. Grid-connected solar photovoltaics is the fastest growing green energy technology, and researchers are still working on improving those efficient systems. For example: researchers found panels that hadn’t been cleaned for long time at summer lost little percent of their efficiency per day.

16107	ROUND-07-161-35$ROUND-07-161-32_1_1	Choosing Furniture for Small Spaces. When styling your home, you want people to feel welcome, so consider moving furniture around to create an open feel and to maximise interior spaces. From practically invisible acrylic chairs to shelving that flexes with the needs of your space. It is possible to make a room feel larger than it really is: Choosing the right colors and finishes and arranging furniture properly can create the illusion of space. For a truly flexible space you need to avoid permanence, or make sure it’s multi purpose. With plenty of storage, a kitchen bench can also work as console or office space. Remember: Living efficiently does not have to mean giving up style and beauty. Kyle Schuneman, co-author of "The First Apartment Book: Cool Design for Small Spaces".
